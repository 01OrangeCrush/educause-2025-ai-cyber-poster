This repository supports the EDUCAUSE 2025 virtual poster presentation:

**"Embedding Generative AI Ethics and Security into Graduate Cybersecurity Curriculum: A Scalable Model for Higher Education"**  
Presented by Jenn McCauley & Edward J. Glantz, Penn State University

## Project Overview

This poster introduces a scalable approach for integrating GenAI ethics, responsible tool use, and cybersecurity governance into a graduate-level cybersecurity project management course. The strategy supports students with diverse technical backgrounds by emphasizing academic integrity, iterative improvement, and ethical AI fluency.

Key components include:
- Assignment scaffolding and feedback loops
- Integration of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly)
- Alignment with EDUCAUSE AI principles and NIST frameworks
- Rubric-based writing support with APA citation reinforcement
